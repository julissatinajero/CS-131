Yes, I do think the helpfulness value may differ significantly between different customers or products. 
The amount of reviews and the value of the reviews could cause drastic differences among various customers/products. For instance, if 
customer 'A' gave a lot of review but the value was low, their overall helpfulness value would be low. If customer 'B' gave a few reviews 
with high value, their overall helpfulness value would be high. The same could be said for products.
