If you are looking for something to stimulate your brain, this isn't it.  However, if you are just looking for a good laugh, you'll enjoy The Bad Girl's Guide.  It's funny and light, and definitely a good way to pass a little bit of time.
It's nice to have a cheeky-style self-help book.  Tuttle's irreverence is refreshing and a couple of her lines made me laugh.  Nonetheless, it's forgettable nonsense and at $14, a tad too expensive for what is offered the reader.
This book is the perfect summer read - light, funny, entertaining, sometimes inspiring.  You can pick it up at any point in the book and begin reading, forget about marking your page, it's not that kind of book.   <br /> <br />I can't wait to read Cameron Tuttle's other Bad Girl books - Viva la Bad Girl!
