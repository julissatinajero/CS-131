 you are looking for something to stimulate your brain this isn't   However  you are just looking for a good laugh you'll enjoy The Bad Girl's Guide  's funny  light  definitely a good way to pass a little bit of time
's nice to have a cheeky-style self-help book  Tuttle's irreverence is refreshing  a couple of her lines made me laugh  Nonetheless 's forgettable nonsense  at $14 a tad too expensive for what is offered the reader
This book is the perfect summer read - light funny entertaining sometimes inspiring  You can pick  up at any point  the book  begin reading forget about marking your page 's not that kind of book    I can't wait to read Cameron Tuttle's other Bad Girl books - Viva la Bad Girl!
I adored this book! I passed  around to all of my friends  the all enjoyed  immensely Great writing very funny Worth my time  worth yours
I wasn't expecting &quotCatcher  the Rye&quot just a few laughs    I was very disappointed     wasn't funny at all    Keep your money but  you really want to buy  buy mine
A great book that shows how serious life doesn't have to be Yes some of the ideas are a little out there but they show that things sometimes aren't as stressful as we make them to be Things that are covered are how to lose a looser how to score more free drinks forms of alternative dating  much more All the advice is very fun  very witty This book is not for the ultra conservative serious  uptight Is for the person who likes to laugh  think about ways to get whatever you want Even  these are not logical ways the seed is planted I have to admit I've scored many free drinks from her great  pracical methods!
TWICE  the whole book  is a cute book but not really funny nor usefull  anywayunless your 18 then you might get away with some of the stunts  here I think I found 3 fairly good tips other than that I was done with the book  under an hour  can't wait to get rid of 
I bought this book after seeing a review  a magazine  I didn't put  down until I'd finished  The author offers a fresh perspective  crazy tips on how to be the best  badest girl I cried from laughter  then went out  bought 3 copies to give to my best female friends Another book that I found intense was &quotHe Never Called Again&quot Now after reading the other book I could really enjoy &quotThe Bad Girl's Guide&quot Yes!
This book was incredibly spontaneous  makes you laugh like crazy  you can actually take most of the advice given No the advice isn't spiritual  what  takes to be a woman 's just a lot of fun   helps you bring the goodness  childhood out of you You responsibly decide what advice you'd prefer to take [though A LOT tend to be very jokeful  not actually serious] 's a cute book you can read  you just need a getaway from actually being responsible  serious 24/7
Belleluv had  right Hilarious  you get  enjoy Cameron Tuttle's sense of humor This book never fails to make me laughJust the chapter on being bad at work alone is worth its priceJust thinking of doing some of these things to my boss makes the stress melt awayEvery girl whether she acts on   not Can be a &quotbad girl&quot at heart  celebrate the power of being Baaaaad!
I really enjoyed reading this book  look forward to reading more  her stuff
Let's start out by saying that  you are aiming to manipulate people  step on others on your way to the top of the ladder this isn't a guide book But maybe you need  anyway because you should LOOSEN UP! The Bad Girl's Guide is all about finding what you REALLY want as opposed to what society dictates 's about loving life living large  going after your desires with passion  no regrets 's an inspiration to take on the world with a mischevious grin  not care when you mis-spell mischevious (like myself) 's viewing your life with the rose-colored glasses everyone should have because nothing is as bad as  seems Except a Bad Girl of course! Indulge  a bubble bath recline with the book  rediscover why 's so fun to be a Bad Girl
How silly  WEll anyway getting what you want isn't always good for you  's knowing the difference between what you need  what you want that makes you a responsible person whether you are a man  a woman
This book had me laughing out loud for almost the entire book! There's advice on everything from what to do with pantiliners (I'm laughing even now) to 10 things to do with your boss's business card (I just got laid off so the latter was of particular interest to me) Of course  you actually DO some of these things you need your head examined This book is great fun for any woman with common sense &amp who needs a laugh
's great little book for laughs- with a good message that we forget- to have fun  make our own rules- So some of the advice is ridiculous but so what?
 even wrote an inscription  the cover for her decided to flip through a few more pages  kept the book!!  is a fantastic read for rainy days sick days sad days  any day that you just need a pick me up The &quotBad Girl&quot attitude is witty fun  satirical The ideas are outlandish  wicked  honestly no one would get away with half of this stuff  the real world but why not read  on a cold rainy winter's day  let your spirits perk up with some fantastic &quotrole playing&quot therapy! 's a must-have pure  simple!
Okay so some of the suggestions are a little crazy  would never work  the real world  Then again no one reads Spiderman comic  decides to try to spin spider webs  THis is one of those books that  you are having a bad day you can read get a laugh  feel moderately better  Some of  is actually helpful should you decide to do   some is just plain silly  You'll actually have to use the ol' grey matter to decide which is which  (Don't worry  won't be that hard)Read  you:  get into Saturday Night Live humor like woman-power laughs have ever had one of &quotthose days&quot  need a good laughDon't read  you:  don't get into the ultra-feminism attitude (that's okay you don't have to) don't enjoy Seinfeld  SNL etc want a serious help book (this really isn't serious)
This &quotBad Girl's Guide&quot book was just less than slightly entertaining -  The title implies the book might be a helpful &quotguide&quot when  fact  is simply full of ridiculous lists Some parts of the book were actually quite humorous while the content was lacking - Just don't expect to get anything out of  except a couple of laughs
I picked this book up  Vegas at the Hard Rock gift shop  I was a on trip there with my best girlfriend  We had a blast reading this book together  sharing secrets  The best chapter is how to get your bartenders attention  We'd tried a few of the lines out  Vegas  they worked real well  This book is more fun to share than to read by yourself
Borrowed this from a friend  couldn't put  down  'Are you a bad girl' quiz was probably the funniest part of this book  Just as much fun as reading &quotBad Girl's Guide to the Open Road&quot  Get this!Also recommended: &quotNo One's Even Bleeding&quot &amp &quotDelano&quot
YOU'LL HAVE SO MUCH FUN READING THIS BOOK OTHER PEOPLE WILL B JEALOUS ^^ OF U!
This is definitely a book that would be fun to take literally Cameron Tuttle's writing style is very unique  very hilarious this book has changed my opinion on a lot of things  has made me see things  a brighter light The book makes you get a grip of yourself  get a life  is honestly my bible Even my boyfriend loved  - he wouldn't give  back to me till he was done going through all the &quotmen&quot sections which we both found hilarious  you don't choose to take the book entirely seriously then buy  for the sake of a good laugh Either way this book will change your life - maybe only slightly - but significantly
I got this as a gift  I think 's so cute not worth 15$ but so nice for a girl friend who is hard to shop for   has a great love of life  adventure You know the one that you just might get into trouble with 
 you are not into PDAs (Public Displays of Amusement) don't read this  public!  Super fun  leaves you wanting more -- thank God she has more  this series!
This is a great funny  informative book for young adults
Personally I thought this book was really cute just from the little cartoon drawings but the more I actually started reading  the more funny (  some instances true)  became to me &quotBad girls make  happen A bad girl knows what she wants  how to get  She makes her own rules makes her own way  makes no apologies She knows when to work a room when to work the angles  when to work her curves- do all of the above&quot Topics range from Getting a Date to Getting a Life Although  wouldn't really be possible to follow some of the suggestions  this book (ie &quotThings to do with pantyliners: Add cushioning to any phone receiver for hours of pain-free shoulder cradling&quot) unless your goal was to alienate your roommates  become a social outcast  really makes you laugh nonetheless However the one message  doesn't fail to reiterate time  time again for all women is to be strong  be your own woman
Slim as this book is 's actually two books mixed up  each other  They're both good books worth reading  Sometimes however you won't know which one a given page  paragraph belongs toThe first book is a humorous look at some of the many gutsy outrageous things you've probably always wanted to do - whether  not you knew    includes amusing advice on how to exploit your feminine wiles to score everything from free drinks to free office supplies  's easy-to-read  nicely illustrated  is good for at least a few laughsThe second book is a bit of serious advice for the woman who has spent her life fulfilling other people's needs  ignoring her own  The party line: wise up toughen up kick your insecurities to the curb  start getting what you want from life - even  requires extreme measures  The book becomes confusing when the author brings humor to her serious advice  the question arises as to what we're meant to take seriously  what we're not  I'm sure the line about stealing other people's drinks with a two-foot straw was a joke  I hope the section about dating yourself before you find a boyfriend - learning to love  indulge yourself - was serious  I'm not sure what to think about the page devoted to getting men to buy you drinks through various forms of flirtation  deception  Regardless this much is true of \\"The Bad Girl's Guide To Getting What You Want\\": 's funny   might make you think  might confuse you  might make you roll your eyes at the obviousness of its message  But 's funny
I can not recommend this book highly enough  covers  all from your relationships to your career your friendships  your social life  is packed full of \\"What to do with\\" lists For example what do you do with your boss's business cards? Simple Write \\"Nice job idiot\\" on the back  place them under the windshield wipers of badly parked cars (I find this also works quite well with the business cards of ex-boyfriends) also gives wonderful advice on how to deal with very tricky situations For example  you find yourself on the first date from hell  you encounter a man at a club who simply will not leave you alone  won't take no for an answer the solution is simple Simply lean across the table look deep into his eyes  say \\"I'm so glad we've met I think you would make a wonderful father for my hyperactive disabled son\\" This is an absolutely hilarious read that will keep you thoroughly entertained while offering some great advice for those of us who are bad  simply dream of being I also highly recommend \\"The Bad Girl's Guide To The Open Road\\"  \\"The Bad Girl's Guide To The Party Life\\"
This book is hilariously funny  is empowering  interesting Although  may appear somewhat shallow  has a deeper message: women should know their worth Historically women who have dared to live their lives exactly as they wanted have been considered a threat to society  unfortunately this still has some meaning today This is an inspirational guide for women Although some advice may seem a little bit extreme they are written tongue  cheek Bad girls are not \\"bad\\" - but they do not compromise their lives for a man  anyone else for that matter Reading this book is *almost* better than chocolate -  is very confidence boosting
You either get Cameron Tuttle's books  her brand of humor  you don't Personally I love her books The Bad Girl's Guide To Getting What You Want is my favorite of hers There's good solid advice but theres also tons of fun  badness without making you want to puke  the book This book isn't supposed to be a survival guide 's supposed to help you realize what you want  then show you that you've got all that you need right  your bad girl selfThe book does this by covering major aspects of life clarifying them with humor  showing you different ways to get through [bad] stuff- Like job interviews Overall I think this book is great for anyone who goes at a life with a sense of humor but not really for those who are looking for a new spiritual outlook  some sort revelation on what  is to be a woman
 you're expecting usable tips about living la dolce vita throw this book away  buy Swell by Cynthia Rowley  Ilene Rosenzweig instead    you're broad-minded try Shar Radnour's Femme's Guide to the Universe   you want to wear panty-liners as a moustache buy this book
I'm all for the bad girl  girly books revolution but this book was just a little too incoherent  meaningless for my taste  Basically this book is a collection of useless ridiculous lists of nothing tips on how to accomplish nothing  absolutely nothing that means anything (to me at least)  Books I found much cuter  more appealing include 3 Skirts  The Go-Girl Guide -- both actually contain content
Oh my Godess I love this book! 's hilarious! But only  you get the humor (which clearly some dingos do not Phew! That's a good thing) Frankly this book changed my life I now find absurd humor  every day advice  everday advice  absurd humor  just makes me laugh 's a faboo gift for any uptight girlfriend who needs a little loving kick  to snap out of   for a super bad girl who wants to sharpen her game Don't give  get bad!
This is the stupidist book I ever read  Not funny  a waste of money  Her other Bad girl book was just as stupid  I should have read the reviews before I bought them both  &quotI was stupid&quotNot so again  I wish there was a &quot0&quot star rating
This book is a must read for almost any woman (not to mention a few men too!)  Although this book is full of hilarious schemes suggestions  games the best part is after you read  you realize how good  feels to be a girl  I even got my brother  a few guy friends to read  just to gain a little insight into what we might be going through  A lot of  is purely for good laughs  to teach us to not take ourselves for granted  too seriously but the message is clear we rock!  I am giving this to all my bad girlfriends!
You must have this book Seriously Find out how to land the perfect pad find a fab job score free drinks ( you're into that bar scene)  plenty of advice on boys kissing  well everything  between Discover what you really mean when you say you want a better boyfriend You might just need a therapist  a puppy instead ()
What a great book!!  Full of practical hysterical suggestions for adding a little spice to your life   will give you a whole new perspective on how to go about getting what you want whatever that may be  I plan on giving this book to several of my girl friends with the hopes of turing them bad too!
The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is that I think  might have limited appeal to the over 30 crowd I have some women friends  that age group who could really benefit from the central theme of the book - that of taking control of your life  making   this crazy world But the actual areas of advice - like getting a job finding a man finding an apartment are things that aren't as relevant to them My favorite thing was the quizzes  the neat borders of the pages the wonderful &quotI want&quot ideas Even though I wouldn't have the guts to do all the things she suggests just imagining  was an ego boost I pick  up  read a section whenever I'm down  the dumps   always picks me up I've read sections to my best friend  we both laughed until we cried Definitely worth the time  the money
I not only own this book I also own the Bad Girl's Guide to the Open Road I keep that one  my car  this one  my workbag Hil-AR-ious!  you don't take  too seriously this book can help you  you do you need more help than this book can offer The pictures are great  the ongoing commentary on the bottom of each pagewell any bad girl could identify  you're a bad girl you'll love this book   you're not 'll convert you This book  's sister book have helped me find the times  my life when i needed to be a little bad Thanks Cameron! Keep  up!
I LOVED this book  I have no idea how I lived without   's super entertaining  funny     you're looking for practical conservative advice look elsewhere   you want some laughs  to feel inspired to be the craziest naughtiest silliest bad girl you can be then you need to read this!
What can I say about this excellent literary tour de force?  Well  is one of the funniest books I have read  ages!! Yes some of the idea's are not practical but they are hilarious!! I seriously recommend this book to any girl that is sick  tired of being nice!!   There is a world of fun out there  being a bad girl only makes  better!
This has to be one of the best books ever!!  was soooo funny  i could not get over  Even though i probably wont ever use those tips  was fun to read about &quothow to&quot achieve the stereotyped bad girl image that deep down every girl wants to be i took the quizzes  laughed endlessly while sharing the book with the whole cabin everyone loved   i cant get enough of  all i want is a sequel
I bought this book thinking  would be a little something to uplift my spirits on days when I was feeling down I was a little disapointed to discover that the book is written as  the author wanted you to do some of the things she talks about  does have some good points to   gives ideas on how to raise self-esteem  self image but other then that  is fairly shallow So  you are like me  just looking for something a little humorous this one is too on the serious side
This book has like 2 good tips  they were about how to feel good  raise your self-esteem on one of those days when you're just &quotblue&quot The rest of this book is just mindless &quotUses for a pantyliner&quot Who cares!?!? Will you even use these tips? I farely doubt    you do something is wrong with you This book is intended to be funny but is not The suggestions about dating  guys is really dumb  you can go to a local bookstore flip through  but don't waste your money on 
Cameron Tuttle's _Bad Girl's Guide to the Open Road_ was really an original book  Good advice combined with just the right amount of irreverence made  both practical  amusing  However as its followup _Getting What You Want_ falls flat  Tuttle tries to cover too many &quotbad girl&quot topics  one book leaving the reader with a sense that depth is better than breadth   Tuttle were to write a &quotbad girl&quot book based on something like work  dating  some other centralized theme then I'd try her again  Generalizations about being a &quotbad girl&quot are no substitute for its predecessor
This was the most HYSTERICAL book I have ever read  my whole life!  I think the best part is that after you have read the book  decided to become a Bad Girl you can go to the [] website  chat with out Bad Girls  even get your own Bad Girl Email! This book is so funny that I couldnt read  on the subway becase I didnt want to be sitting there laughing by myself  look like a subway lunatic!
I like many of the others reviwers bought this book based on the description  high ratings  seemed like  would be the kind of book I really like I was so disappointed  seems to be characterized as some sort of feminist work but  regards to the book's advice about catching men(much of the focus here inane suggestions  tips abound)  is clearly not Not to mention that  is just a horrible book 's cheesy unappealing  kind of mindless  boring  contradicts itself I realize  is supposed to be funny at least to some degree  isn't funny  Check out The Bust Guide to the New Girl Order  anything by Cynthia Heimel
Though a lot of the items are purely for laughs (stealing office TP by tieing rolls to the bottoms of your feet  using them as platforms) there is a ton of really useful information that can really be put to use (how to get more free drinks at the bar through stratigic spills)'s amusing  uplifting 's a very good read for girls that are already bad  feel like they are the only one (Hard to exchange tips  you have no bad girl friends!) For those who wish to be bad - 's a great way to start I hope to see many more bad girl works  the future
I really do laugh out loud every time I open this book  is packed with hilarious stuff Crazy witty wild bad girl advice about managing your life your career your relationships--all with bad girl style The kind of stuff that makes you pick up your phone  call your sister  Boston to read her an excerpt just to hear her laugh 's a fun read cover to cover  also great to leave lying around the house for those moments when you need a laugh Since reading her books I've given Cameron Tuttle's bad girl's guides (both this  the Bad Girl's Guide to the Open Road) as gifts to my mom (she loves ) my sister (ditto)  all of my bad girl friends Do yourself a favor  buy this book!

 you want the only guide for being a bad girl  this is your book I could not put this book down  I highly recomend this book to all my friends
Whimsical engaging flirtatious this book is less a how-to guide for achieving what you want than a manifesto on treating yourself right  Sure this book boasts a lot of tips  tricks (many of them hilarious)  some smart advice about jobs  career (eg treating your job interview like a TV talk-show appearance)  But underlying the specific ideas for &quotscoring love fame money power parking spaces  other essentials&quot is an important message about prioritizing your own happiness  Aim high dream big ask for what you want be happy with yourself before you get into a relationship (of any sort) - these are the real lessons this book has to offer  As an aside some women may find troubling Cameron Tuttle's implication that being a bad girl means having a certain approach to sex eg her &quotAre you a bad girl&quot quiz:  &quotThe last time I got naked with a stranger I was [at 35000 feet]&quot &quotHow do you spell relief during a stressfull work day? [o-r-g-a-s-m-s]&quot &quotMy favorite form of multi-tasking is [faking not having an orgasm  spinning class]&quot  This characterization contradicts the otherwise-clear empowering theme of the book:  that there are an infinite number of ways of being a high-attitude sassy  fearless Bad Girl
This book is not only hysterical  's a wry education  girlhood for any reader - us guys included  I went to the author's local reading  my hometown  the place was packed  everyone fell out of their chairs laughing at this wild  funny author as she read  I've sent several copies as gifts to women friends who could use a little bad  their lives -  every one of them has called  emailed to rave about this quirky book  I doubt many guys are reading this site but those who are buy your girl this book  then hang on for the ride -  you can
great advice for all ages definately worth reading!   really is the bad girl's bible  can be applied to every aspect of life
I loved this book   is a hilarious tongue--cheek guide to living  the modern world for women of all ages  backgrounds  With helpful advice on everything from scoring a job interview to finding an apartment this is the best self-help book to come along  years  Can't wait to buy  read the Guide to the Open Road  any further tomes from Ms Tuttle
This book was excellent Some of the suggestions may not be applicable  real life as suggested by another review but the idea is what you take into the real world This book encourages women to take control of their own lives  not put up with any bologna from people  is a humerous guide to learning to take control of your own life
Cameron Tuttle is a goddess  Sure some of the ideas  here aren't the most practical  you'd have to be pretty gutsy to do a number of the things she recommends  However this book  her previous book are filled not only with nifty useful information but also with funny ( sometimes poignant) anecdotes from people other than herself so you can get another point of view  I would recommend this book to *any* woman who needs an esteem boost some helpful hints  just a really good laugh  Matter of fact I've already purchased more copies to give to other friends as gifts  I LOVE THIS BOOK!
this was an absolutely fabulous book!  my mother got  for me for christmas knowing just the kind of person i ami LOVED !   gave me great ideas on having fun being &quotscandalous&quot  just being a 21 year old having the time of her lifewhat more can you ask for?  cameron's an awesome bad girl with definate potential for more wonderful books!!
Fabulously hysterical!  Not sure that everyone should actually take this book too seriously however  is extremely entertaining  Best shared with friends while drinking wine
This book was absoulely wonderful Cameron Tuttle is an amazing author who really knows how to get what she wants  not let any wussie with a boring attitude get  her way! Anyone who doesn't like this book just has no sence of humor  probably doesn't know how to have fun anyway! This book is a must-have for any cool girl Way to go Cameron when is the next one???
I knew from just reading the title of the book that  would be a book that I would find hard to put down  I bought  for my best bad girl friend  gave  to her only after I had read  cover to cover  I now have a copy of  myself  often read  over again to get a few laughs  The author Cameron Tuttle is ingenious  many of the tips she offers are not to be taken seriously but as an inspiration  I recommend this book to women who have a sense of humor  who are looking for little ways to bring out the law abiding badness instilled within all of us
the only thing good about this book is the nice size  cover  okay  has cute illustrations   would look cute on my bookshelf but  was much cuter when i was returning  for a refund you want a book that will really help you along the way try SWELL  three black skirtsthis book is mostly sarcastic humour  fluff  a bit of self-esteem enhancing material but nothing really signifigant
I bought this book based on the reviews seen here  I was EXTREMELY disappointed!   is filled with a bunch of silly suggestions that would make NO SENSE at all  the real world  I have read other book such as the GO GIRL GUIDE that were helpful  encouraging for me  This was not one of them  I don't say this a lot about books but  really was a total WASTE of time  money!
I bought the book based on eight 5-star reviews  As a matter of fact I bought several sight unseen to give away because the book was said to be so wonderful  All 8 reviewers said  was marvelous!  I disagree  Sure the book has some great uplifting material that can boost self-esteem for women  But  has more bogus material   that encourages young women to be phoney  to resort to trickery to get men to do what they want  NOT GOOD  That kind of behavior does not boost self-esteem for women  will ultimately backfire  I sent the books back
This is hilarious!  Thanks to a dear friend I spent hours laughing over the outrageous stuff  this book  Whatever your need may be there is something  this book for you  How to scam for free drinks how to plant a kiss on a stranger how to get the dust bunnies from under the furniture (don't tell PETA) - I can't look at Post-Its without laughing anymore
I absolutely positively LOVE this bookit is not only a great  fun read  rings true for all women out there! I got mine as a gift  am planning to buy one for all my girlfriends!
I bought this book after seeing a review  a magazine  I didn't put  down until I'd finished   The author offers a fresh perspective  crazy tips on now to be the best  badest girl  the new millennium  I cried from laughter  then went out  bought 3 copies to give to my bestest female friends
 you don't have a sense of humor don't buy The Bad Girl's Guide To Getting What You Want  Among other great advice this book explains how to get a date lose a date get a job  then do as little as possible to keep the job  is racy edgy  often downright crude I LOVED  I picked  up  the airport  didn't even have to &quotlose to loser&quot next to me on the flight because I was laughing so hard my 7-Up was coming out my nose  I had been given &quotthe man translator&quot at age 16 my hair wouldn't be gray today I especially appreciated the advice on taking the mini vacations (that I deserve) from work  So far this month I've had minor surgery jury duty  traffic court (but really I've had massages facials  pedicures) I can't wait to give these as stocking stuffers to all of my friends  family good  bad alike
Buy this book! Buy a copy for yourself one for your best friend one for your mother  a copy for every woman  your life Makes you remember why you love being female I ended up reading most of  out-loud to my best friend over the phone We laughed  screamed  loved  all
This book is for the &quotbad girl&quot  all of us!  's loaded with amazingly entertaining writing  I'd love to step into Tuttle's mind to see how she comes up with this great stuff!    you just can't get enough of the witty advise  character profiles the author takes you one step deeper with her &quotNote to Self&quot entries  bottom margin subtext  For anyone who believes that girl power lives you MUST read this book  PS The illustrations are as much fun as the writing (check out page 153)
When I saw that Cameron Tuttle had a sequel to her fabulous book The Bad Girl's Guide to the Open Road I was skeptical Follow up books are often disappointments Boy was I wrong!! This book is even more hilarious sharp witted  inspiring than the first  Don't miss !
I was first attracted by the cover   is richly designed  grabs you right away  Then I looked inside!   is so entertaining  A funny book to have on your coffee table for friends to read  A true bad girls book!   tells you everything from filling  gaps  your resume with funny excuses to climbing the corporate ladder  Excellent writing!
